1. Two Sum/
Recurse twice --> O(n^2)
Could use a Hash Map for better complexity
--> O(n)

206. Reverse Linked List   /
Spacial & Temporal Complexity
Adding a Prev pointer to save "space": Spcial O(1) vs O(n)

903. Valid Permutations for DI Sequence/
Using python @lru_cache(None)
using dynamic programming to avoid repeated work

21. Merge Two Sorted Lists /
Could implement using recursion
Could also have O(1) complexity by using pointers
