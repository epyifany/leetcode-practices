1. Two Sum/
* Recurse twice --> O(n^2)
* Could use a Hash Map for better complexity--> O(n)

206. Reverse Linked List/

* Spacial & Temporal Complexity
* Adding a Prev pointer to save "space": Spcial O(1) vs O(n)

903. Valid Permutations for DI Sequence/ 

* Using python @lru_cache(None)
* using dynamic programming to avoid repeated work

21. Merge Two Sorted Lists /

* Could implement using recursion
* Could also have O(1) complexity by using pointers

892. Surface Area of 3D Shapes:
* Reading the question: be more patient and plug in variables  
* <strong> parenthesis on pointers while incrementing </strong>,  debugging by segments 
* Using comments smartly
* Using auto keyword/ptrs, vector indexes, syntactic sugar in cpp.
* Problem of 3D shapes: use (sum - touching) rather than six sides(hidden surfaces)
