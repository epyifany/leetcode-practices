1. Two Sum/
Recurse twice --> O(n^2)
Could use a Hash Map for better complexity
--> O(n)

206. Reverse Linked List   /
Spacial & Temporal Complexity
Adding a Prev pointer to save "space": Spcial O(1) vs O(n)

903. Valid Permutations for DI Sequence/
Using python @lru_cache(None)
using dynamic programming to avoid repeated work

Could implement using recursion
Could also have O(1) complexity by using pointers

892. Surface Area of 3D Shapes/

  Reading the question: be more patient and plug in variables 
  ** parenthesis on pointers while incrementing **,  debugging by segments
  Using comments smartly
  Using auto keyword/ptrs, vector indexes, syntactic sugar in cpp.
  Problem of 3D shapes: use (sum - touching) rather than six sides(hidden surfaces)
